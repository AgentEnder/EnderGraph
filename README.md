# EnderGraph
## What is it?
EnderGraph is a graph theory library for python. It is in no way comprehensive, namely it currently lacks algorithmic analysis of graphs. It contains methods to create a graph, add nodes and edges, remove edges, set edge weights, make a graph complete, and display graphs.
## How does it work?
EnderGraph has 2 dependencies, but they are both included in the base python distribution. The turtle library, and the math library. Both dependencies are only used in the display method, so if that is not needed they can be removed.
The only object contained in EnderGraph.py is the Graph class. It contains all current methods.
